# Predicting_puppy-s_mood
Our deep learning model can predict your puppy's mood just my looking at the image. Puppy's can have 3 different moods - Sad, Relaxed, Happy. We have used Pytorch, Cuda framework, Python, Deep Learning Neural Networks.

In this Project, we have implemented a deep neural network designed based on the initial layers of ResNet50 archictecture to identify the mood of the puppy. The dataset consists of more than 13000 images and reprocessing them we have utilised more than 50000 images
